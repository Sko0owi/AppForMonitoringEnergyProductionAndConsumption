# App For Monitoring Energy Production And Consumption (Iskra am550)
Simple app for monitoring monthly production and consumption of energy generated in household which is equipped with electricity meter "Iskra am550"

## Why I did this?

One day my dad gave me this "special task" to enter monthly usage and production of energy that he noted on piece of paper in to the excel and make him some graph. 
Quickly I thought that would be too easy (and boring), so I came up with an idea to make simple app in Python that will do it. 
It was my first Python project and I used such libraries as PyQt5 and matplotlib. 

## How to use it?

It's pretty simple, open mainApp.py and you will be greeted with 4 buttons, "Dodaj nowe dane", "Usuń ostatnie dane", "Edytuj dane" and "Pokaż wykres". First one is an option to save another monthly readings, second one deletes the last readings and third one with your input allows you to edit some readings. And the last one generates some graph (with timestamp and type of recording you want). Besides that on console you can see current status of your readings printed. 

## Will I expand this project?

Probably not, maybe if my dad will find some bug or he will have some idea to make his life easier I will fix/implement it.
